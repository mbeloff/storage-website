        <p>
          Storage space comes at a premium in houses and offices in Brisbane,
          and sometimes extra space has to be sacrificed in favour of a lower
          purchase price or rent. That’s perhaps why so many people are turning
          to self storage units in Brisbane: the weekly cost of a self storage
          unit is low in comparison to the cost of extra rent or mortgage
          payments on a larger property.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-title"><span>Self-storage for households</span></h3>
        <p>
          Self storage units can be used for all sorts of things and can be a
          real space-saver for your home.

        <p>
          If you run a business, you might rent a self storage unit rather than
          commit to a long commercial lease on a larger property. Our self
          storage facilities don’t attract business rates, and the amount of
          space you can rent is adjustable, which makes it an affordable,
          flexible alternative to traditional warehousing. You can store excess
          stock, tools, equipment or archives.

            <strong>Moving in together:</strong> What to do with all your stuff
            when moving in with a partner? Self-storage can help in the short
            term while you decide.

            <strong>New baby:</strong> Make use of a storage unit while you
            clear out to make room for a nursery.

            <strong>Downsizing:</strong> Moving into a new house can be very
            stressful; moving into a smaller place even more so. Self-storage
            can help during the period, while you decide what's really worth
            keeping.
